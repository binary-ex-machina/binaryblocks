# Binary Blocks
A repository was created to help Binary Blocks users learn and get inspiration to build any strategies for block-based web applications. Only JSON files will be provided since it's for the Binary Blocks system and not other systems. Some blocks exist exclusively 

Access the Binary Blocks web app [here](https://binaryblocks.pro)

If you have any suggestions or want help creating your strategy? open your issue [here](https://github.com/binary-ex-machina/binaryblocks/issues)
